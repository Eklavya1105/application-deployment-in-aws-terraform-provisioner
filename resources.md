### Step 3 : Creating resource configuration files

1. Copy the resource files from my repository and paste them as I have done.
2. It is important to create new files for each individual resource; do not paste every resource into a single file.
3. You can customize each file as needed.
4. Copy variable.tf and paste it into a new file named variables.tf.
5. Create a terraform.tfvars file and assign values to variables.
6. Finally, your folder should resemble the picture below.
7. One thing to remember , we didn't hardcode any values in these resource files and we will provide values as variables.
